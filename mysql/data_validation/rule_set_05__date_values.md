### T016 - Not Null
Verify date field is not null.  For example, to verify that table countries has no NULLs in field date_last_updated:
```sql
SELECT date_last_updated
     , CASE WHEN date_last_updated IS NULL THEN 'FAIL' ELSE 'P' END AS status
FROM demo_hr.countries;
```
<br>


<a id="t017" class="anchor" href="#t017" aria-hidden="true"> </a>
### T017 - Date Range
Verify date field is within specified range.  For example, you can run the sql below to verify that table countries field date_last_updated is between 1/1/2021 and today.  Note the use of SYSDATE to represent today's date dynamically in Oracle.  Notice the inner query uses a CASE...WHEN...ELSE structure to identify two rejections codes: (1) date is too high, and (2) date is too low.  Expected and actual values are displayed in the output if you run the inner query only.  The outer query is a wrapper to determine whether the test passed or failed.
```sql
SELECT date_last_updated
     , CASE WHEN date_last_updated > NOW()        THEN CONCAT('REJ-01: Field date_last_updated cannot be in the future|exp<=', CAST(NOW() AS CHAR(20)), '|act=', CAST(date_last_updated AS CHAR(20)) )
            WHEN date_last_updated < '2021-01-01' THEN CONCAT('REJ-02: Field date_last_updated cannot be too old|exp>=1/1/2021|act=', CAST(date_last_updated AS CHAR(20)) )
            ELSE 'P'
       END AS status
FROM demo_hr.countries;
```
<br>


<a id="t018" class="anchor" href="#t018" aria-hidden="true"> </a>
### T018 - No Time Part
Verify date field is a date only, no time part present.  For example, to verify that table employees has no time part in field hire_date (time part must be "12:00:00"):
```sql
SELECT hire_date
     , CASE WHEN DATE_FORMAT(hire_date, '%H:%i:%s') <> '00:00:00'THEN 'FAIL' ELSE 'P' END AS status
FROM demo_hr.employees;
```
<br>


<a id="t019" class="anchor" href="#t019" aria-hidden="true"> </a>
### T019 - Has Time Part
Verify date field is a date **and** time.  For example, to verify that table employees has a time part in field hire_date (time part cannot be "12:00:00"):
```sql
SELECT date_last_updated
     , CASE WHEN DATE_FORMAT(date_last_updated, '%H:%i:%s') = '00:00:00' THEN 'FAIL' ELSE 'P' END AS status
FROM demo_hr.countries;
```
<br>


<a id="t020" class="anchor" href="#t020" aria-hidden="true"> </a>
### T020 - Multi Field Compare
Verify multiple date fields relative to each other.  For example, to verify that field start_date must be < field end_date in table job_history (thus if start_date is >= end_date the test case fails):
```sql
SELECT start_date, end_date
     , CASE WHEN start_date >= end_date THEN 'FAIL' ELSE 'P' END AS status
FROM demo_hr.job_history;
```

### Bonus Tip - Joining Tables with 2 Pairs of Start-End Date Overlaps
So this is a fantastic tip I learned from a co-worker in healthcare back in 2011 (was it Jennifer C.?  or Matt G.?  or Jonathon P.? I can't remember).


The **problem** is that you are trying to join two tables with logic where the table1.start_dt/end_dt's overlap with the table2.start_dt/end_dt.


The **solution** is to **join on `table1.start_dt <= table2.end_dt AND table1.end_dt >= table2.start_dt`**.

Here is why:

```
Scenario #1 = "Discard - No Overlap" Table #1 date range is completely before Table #2's (Dt#1.End is NOT > Dt#2.Start)
Table#1:  |Start ----------- End|
Table#2:                            |Start ----------- End|
                          

Scenario #2 = "Include - Table #1 End = Table#2 Start" Table #1 date range ends exactly where Table #2's starts (Tbl#1.End = Tbl#2.Start  AND  Tbl#1.Start < Tbl#2.End)
Table#1:      |Start ----------- End|
Table#2:                            |Start ----------- End|


Scenario #3 = "Include - Table #1 Ends Midway Table #2 Span" Table #1 date range nicely overlaps Table #2's (Tbl#1.End > Tbl#2.Start  AND  Tbl#1.Start < Tbl#2.End)
Table#1:                |Start ----------- End|
Table#2:                            |Start ----------- End|                  


Scenario #4 = "Include - Table #1 Starts Midway Table #2 Span" Table #1 date range nicely overlaps Table #2's (Tbl#1.End > Tbl#2.Start  AND  Tbl#1.Start < Tbl#2.End)
Table#1:                                     |Start ----------- End|
Table#2:                            |Start ----------- End|                  
                  

Scenario #5 = "Include - Table #1 Starts at Table #2 End" Table #1 date range start exactly at Table #2's End (Tbl#1.End > Tbl#2.St  AND  Tbl#1.St = Tbl#2.End)
Table#1:                                                  |Start ----------- End|
Table#2:                            |Start ----------- End|                  
                  

Scenario #6 = "Discard - No Overlap" Date #1 is entirely after Date #2 (Tbl#1.Start is > Tbl#2.End)
Table#1:                                                       |Start ----------- End|
Table#2:                            |Start ----------- End|                  

```
