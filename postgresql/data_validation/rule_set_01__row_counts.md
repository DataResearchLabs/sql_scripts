### T001 - "Full" Row Count
Verify full row count for a table or view.  For example, to verify that table countries has exactly 25 rows:
 ```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) <> 25 THEN 'FAIL' ELSE 'P' END AS status 
FROM demo_hr.countries;
 ```
<br>


<a id="t002" class="anchor" href="#t002" aria-hidden="true"> </a>
### T002 - "Partial" Row Count
Verify partial row count for a subset of a table or view.  For example, to verify that table countries has exactly 8 rows where region_id = 1 (Europe):
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) <> 8 THEN 'FAIL' ELSE 'P' END AS status   
FROM demo_hr.countries
WHERE region_id = 1;
```

<a id="t003" class="anchor" href="#t003" aria-hidden="true"> </a>
### T003 - "Relative" Row Count
Verify relative row counts between tables or views.  The example below verifies that table countries has at least 5 times the number of rows as table regions.  The inner query returns one row with two columns: (a) count of contries, and (b) count of regions.  The outer query can then apply the business logic of comparing the counts and returning a Pass or Fail.
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN countries_count < 5 * regions_count THEN 'FAIL' ELSE 'P' END AS status
FROM (
  SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM demo_hr.countries) AS countries_count 
       , (SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM demo_hr.regions)   AS regions_count
) t;
```
<br>


<a id="t004" class="anchor" href="#t004" aria-hidden="true"> </a>
### T004 - "Recent" Row Count
Verify recent row counts.  The example below verifies that table countries has had at least 5 rows updated in the past 10 days based on the date stamp in field date_last_updated.  The inner query uses GETDATE() (SQL Server current date time stamp) and subtracts 10 days.  The inner query counts how many rows in table countries have a date_last_updated with the past 10 days.  The outer query can then confirm that at least 5 rows are recent for a Pass...if not then it returns a Fail.
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN row_count < 5 THEN 'FAIL' ELSE 'P' END AS status
FROM (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count 
  FROM demo_hr..countries
  WHERE date_last_updated >= NOW()::DATE - 150
) t;
```
