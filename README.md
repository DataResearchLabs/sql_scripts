## [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/DataResearchLabs/sql_scripts/blob/main/data_dictionary_scripts.md)
The Data Dictionary script and tutorials enable you to easily document an existing database schema.  You can dump the tables, views, column descriptions, data types/lengths/sizes/precision, key constraints, and other information.  Export to Excel for pretty output and simple filtering, searching, and sharing.<br>

## [SchemaDiff](https://github.com/DataResearchLabs/sql_scripts/blob/main/schemadiff_scripts.md)
The SchemaDiff script and tutorials enable you to track changes to your schema over time or between environments.  You'll know exactly what changed last night with a deployment vs. the prior night's stable baseline.  You'll know when folks are changing your development or test environment every morning rather than 15 days later, avoiding all the troubleshooting red herrings.<br>
